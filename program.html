            <p>Boxing (also known as "Western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. More generally, the term boxing can refer to any combat sport in which two opponents face each other in a fight using their fists, covered by gloves in most cases, and differentiated according to their rules, such as Western boxing, French boxing, Chinese boxing, Thai boxing, kickboxing, and the ancient pygmachia.</p></div>

"gentle way" is a system of unarmed combat, modern Japanese martial art and Olympic sport (since 1964).[3][4][5] Judo was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano (嘉納治五郎) as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its predecessors (primarily Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu and Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on "randori" (乱取り, lit. free sparring) instead of "kata" (pre-arranged forms) alongside its removal of striking and weapon training elements.[3][4][6] Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (警視庁武術大会, Keishicho Bujutsu Taikai), resulting in its adoption as the department's primary martial art.[4][3] A judo practitioner is called a "judoka", and the judo uniform is called "judogi".</p></div>
